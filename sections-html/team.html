          <p class="team-desc">Hi, I am Armaan Kautish. I am a fourth year undergraduate physics student. My interests lie in a verity of fields, from particle physics to astrophysics and from quantum computing to aviation. My academic background has given me a strong appreciation for the physical principles that govern motion, energy, and aerodynamics; core ideas that directly inform the future of advance mobility. I am excited to contribute to the club's mission by combining theoretical insight with hands-on applications, and by working with others who share a passion for reimagining how we soar through the skies.</p>
